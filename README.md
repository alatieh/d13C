This paper presents a box-model simulation, implemented in Python, to analyze the concentration of δ¹³C in the Atmosphere, Biosphere, and upper Ocean. Model parameterization was achieved through a statistical comparison of the root mean square error (RMSE) between modeled data and available measurements. Findings indicate a constant fixed difference of **9.43‰** between the δ¹³C of the atmosphere and the ocean surface, confirming an estimated annual flux of about 110 petagram of carbon a year ($PgC/year$) between these two reservoirs.

A linear regression analysis yielded a simple equation relating the oceanic carbon sink to the annual

$Ocean\ sink_{\ modelled} = 81 ×   ocean\ surface\ δ¹³C_{annual\  differences} $

The utilization of this equation predicted an overestimation of 23 $PgC$ in the Global Carbon Project (GCP) calculations of the Oceanic Carbon sink.

Adding this calculated 23 $PgC$ sink to the existing 13 $PgC$ of GCP Budget Imbalance yields a total gap of 36 $PgC$. The paper posits that this gap is likely a consequence of unmodeled sink paths in the GCP, primarily the biological pump, black carbon, and other carbon life forms impacted by anthropogenic chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other which kill the organisms and mummify the carbon.

Lastly, this paper refutes the greening claim by clarifying that the biosphere in GCP encompasses all forms of terrestrial ecosystem carbon, living and dead. Additionally, bookkeeping records indicate deforestation rather than greening. The model further invalidates the greening claim by demonstrating that if other sinks are subtracted from the residual, there would be a **continuous** decrease in the biosphere in the all modelled 173 year.

Through this research, attempts have been made to elucidate the shift in biospheric elements and to assess the magnitude and impact of human-induced environmental destruction.
