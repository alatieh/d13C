δ13C fluctuates in the Earth system as an indicator of the biosphere’s CO₂ photosynthesis and respiration process. Here is a Simple box model for the δ13C concentration change in the Atmosphere, Biosphere, and upper Ocean. The model runs from the year 1850 till today. The model uses the data from Friedlingstein et al. (2022) for the fluxes and reservoir estimation. The measurements from Scrippsco2 project & the Law Dome Ice Core are used as Ground truth to correct and calibrate the model.
As a beginning, here is a back-of-envelope modeling of the system with annual resolution. The next step will be to increase the temporal resolution. I hypothesize that the model will follow previous study conclusions of:

General expected trend is to lower the atmospheric value of δ¹³C.
The same CO2 El Niño pattern expected in the δ¹³C fluctuation.
A repeat of the annual and interannual cycles.

The significance of the model is to improve the quantification of the carbon cycle especially the carbon sink in vegetations
